      <b-card-text>
        I am an HCI researcher at University of Minnesota. My research interest is social computing, data visualization,
        crowdsourcing and educational data mining. My advisor is Loren Terveen and Haiyi Zhu. I'm very interested in
        interpreting people's learning process and generating insights or solutions from data produced by intelligent tutoring system or crowd workers.
